# Team project

This application uses the Google Maps API to insert a map and the map location markers. It also uses the Foursquare Developer API to fetch the location information. In this map, I am locating ice cream shops near San Jose, CA. You will get a list of shops and you can type in some text to filter the location.

## Adding API Keys

The app uses react-google-maps and foursquare apis.
Easy set-up:
- create a .env file in the root directory.
- add .env to .gitigore
- Use the following names in the .env for your keys. 
- REACT_APP_ID=your_4_square_id
- REACT_APP_SECRET=your_4_square_secret
- REACT_APP_MAP_KEY=your_g_map_key
- The create-react-app tool uses REACT_APP_ to identify these variables. If you don't start your API key name with it, create-react-app won't see it.

## Creation
